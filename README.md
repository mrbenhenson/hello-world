A new repo for my freeCodeCamp coursework

Hi, my name is Ben Henson, and I am a Developer for Madison Mott in Bridgeport, CT. I began teaching myself code about two years ago, and left my life as a City Planner last March, 2015. Even though I spend every day learning and writing new code, it's important to never stop doing do. I particularly need to up my .js and .php game. The freeCodeCamp experience appears to be a well-rounded one, and I'm looking forward to it.
